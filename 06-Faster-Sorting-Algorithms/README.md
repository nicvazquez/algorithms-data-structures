# Faster Sorting Algorithms

## Why learn this?

- The sorting algorithms we've learned so far don't scale well
- Try out bubble sort on an array of 100000 elements, it will take quite some time!

## Faster sorts

- There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n)
- There's a tradeoff between efficiency and simplicity
- The more efficient algorithms are much less simple, and generally take longer to understand
